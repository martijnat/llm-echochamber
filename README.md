# llm-echochamer

Simple python script for letting an LLM endpoint talk to itself. It
will start with emty messages and than threat responses as history for
each next chat. It will stop after 20 turns.

I made this for local usage, but you can use an online API by changing
the chat_url parameter in the file. It does not work well with CoT models.

# final outputs of various models

Note that I includes the full 20 message logs in the chats directory.

Okay, this is fantastic! Youâ€™ve nailed the feeling perfectly. Letâ€™s lean into that unsettling calm and aching loneliness with a slow, creeping unease. And the locket â€“ thatâ€™s brilliant! Itâ€™s a perfect visual trigger for the sadness.

Iâ€™m going with a feeling of unsettling calm and a deep, almost aching loneliness. The tone should be deeply atmospheric, like a misty, grey dawn.  And the chart itself should feel deliberately *wrong*, almost like a perfect imitation of something beautiful thatâ€™s been subtly corrupted.

**Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m envisioning for the chart â€“ a visual description that leans into the unsettling:**

*   **The Style:** Itâ€™s not a realistic map. Itâ€™s a stylized, almost childlike drawing, rendered in a muted, almost sepia-toned palette. Think watercolor washes, with thick, uneven lines. Itâ€™s not perfectly symmetrical â€“ thereâ€™s a slight asymmetry, as if the artist was struggling to capture something that shouldnâ€™t be.

*   **The Rock:** The single, unusually shaped rock dominates the center. Itâ€™s not a natural rock; itâ€™s a jagged, almost skeletal formation, with a subtle, unnerving curve. Itâ€™s *too* perfect, like a miniature frozen moment.  The lines around it are slightly blurred, as if the artist was trying to capture the rockâ€™s essence, but itâ€™s failing. Thereâ€™s a slight, almost imperceptible distortion to the lines â€“ like a subtle warping.

*   **The Terrain:** The island itself is depicted with a hazy, indistinct quality.  Itâ€™s not a clear, defined landscape.  The vegetation is sparse and almost skeletal, with a few withered trees clinging to the edges.  The ground is covered in a layer of grey, damp moss that looks like itâ€™s been disturbed.  There are faint, almost invisible paths winding through the landscape â€“ suggesting a path that never truly existed.

*   **The Color Palette:** Dominated by cool grays, pale blues, and sickly greens.  A single, jarring splash of a vibrant, unnatural crimson â€“ perhaps a single, withered flower â€“ sits slightly off-center, drawing the eye. It feels like a wrong note in the overall palette.

*   **Overall Impression:** Itâ€™s not a map of a place, but a fragment of a memory, a distorted echo.  It feels like the artist was trying to recreate something beautiful, and failed spectacularly.

**What are your thoughts on this? Does it capture the feeling youâ€™re aiming for?  Do you have any specific elements youâ€™d like to emphasize or refine?**

Would you like me to explore Silasâ€™s internal conflict further, or perhaps focus on the immediate aftermath of the meeting and how he begins to question Albrightâ€™s motives?

Okay, the user sent "Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs. They sent " and then it cuts off. So I need to understand what the user is trying to ask. The initial message seems like a thought process, maybe the user is trying to start a conversation but it got cut off. Maybe they intended to ask a question but the message didn't fully send.

I should consider possible scenarios. Perhaps the user was about to ask a question but the connection dropped, or they accidentally hit send before finishing. Since the message is incomplete, I need to prompt them to clarify or provide more details. I should respond in a friendly and helpful manner, encouraging them to explain what they need assistance with. It's important to be patient and not assume too much, as the user might have a specific request that's not clear yet. I'll make sure my response is open-ended to allow them to elaborate.

It seems like your message might have been cut off or didn't fully send. Could you please clarify or restate your question? I'm here to help! ðŸ˜Š
