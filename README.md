# llm-echochamer

Simple python script for letting an LLM endpoint talk to itself. It
will start with emty messages and than threat responses as history for
each next chat. It will stop after 20 turns.

I made this for local usage, but you can use an online API by changing
the chat_url parameter in the file.
